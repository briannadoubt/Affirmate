## Set Up Server Development Environment
In order to build and run the server locally you will need to pass in a variety of Arguments and Environment Variables. The Environment Variables are also reccomended on a production server as well, but this repo isn't there yet.

### You will need:
#### Arguments Passed on Launch:
 * `serve --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`
#### Environment Variables
 * `APNS_TEAM_ID`: `<Your Team ID>`
 * `APNS_KEY`: `<Your .pem Private Key (downloaded from developer.apple.com, and configured with APNS permissions)`
 * `APNS_KEY_ID`: `<Your .pem Key ID (found on the page you downloaded your private key from)>`

See the following screenshot for an example of all the required keys and arguments:

## Start the database
Navigate to the `Developer` directory and build the docker containers with `docker-compose`:
```
cd Affirmate/AffirmateServer
docker-compose build db
docker-compose up db
```

## Start the server in Xcode
Before the app will connect to the database, the server needs to be running.

Select the target `Run` and click the play button to build and run the server on your Mac.

It will be running at `http://0.0.0.0:8080`.

You should see `[ NOTICE ] Server starting on http://0.0.0.0:8080 (Vapor/HTTPServer.swift:296)` towards the bottom of the Xcode console.

## Run one of the clients
Now that the database and the server are up and running you can build and run the iOS, watchOS, or macOS apps and they should connect to the same database/server instance running on your Mac.
